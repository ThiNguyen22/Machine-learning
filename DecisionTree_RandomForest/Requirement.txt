1. Analyze and Preprocess data - Check if the dataset has missing values or has any other problem.
2. Feature Engineering
3. Sampling Your Data
4. Build Model
    4. a. Try DecisionTree, RandomForest
    4. b. Try other tree-based model like: XGBoost, CatBoost
5. Perform model on training set and test set using gridsearch CV
6. Measure performance of the model.
7. Which metric is your main metric for this problem and why? What is your main model as well as their params and why?
