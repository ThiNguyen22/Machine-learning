1. Analyze and Preprocess data - Check if the dataset has missing values or has any other problem.
2. Feature Engineering
3. Divide the dataset into 2 training and test sets
4. Use Pipeline
    4. a. Use scaler and dimensional reduction (if it is necessary).
    4. b. Use suitable Naive Bayes for this problem. 
5. Perform model on training set and test set using gridsearch CV
6. Measure performance of the model.
7. Which metric is your main metric for this problem and why? What are your scaler, dimensional reduction and naive bayes model as well as their params? (<= 200 words, also input your opinion or conclusion here)
