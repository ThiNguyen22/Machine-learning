1. Analyze and Preprocess data - Check if the dataset has missing values or has any other problem.
2. Feature Engineering
3. Determine the cluster number
    3. a. Use elbow method as baseline
    3. b. Apply other methods to compare with elbow
4. Use Pipeline
    4. a. Use scaler and dimensional reduction (if it is necessary).
    4. b. Use suitable clustering model for this problem. 
5. Visualize your cluster in 2D or 3D to compare the result.
6. Measure performance of your clustering model.
7. Conclusion and Discussion (<= 200 words, also input your opinion or conclusion here)
